The files contained here may be used in conjection with the parameters given in thebody of the thesis to set up the bocop problem files. 
The files needed to do this are:
boundarycond.tpp
criterion.tpp
dynamics.tpp
pathcond.tpp
measure.tpp
problem (CONSTANTS File)
problem (BOUNDS File)
problem.def

To use the codes, copy and paste all files into a folder.
Open the problem using the Bocop GUI via file -> open problem -> problem.def.
Use build to build executable
Use run to run solver.
